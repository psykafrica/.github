1. Not everyone is able to stand up for themselves, sometimes an individual needs an advocate because of fears of humuliation and being overwhelmed by their status

**What we want to build**

> We want to find out if you would be okay sharing your story here. We found out that sometimes the reason that individuals don't share what they are going through with their families, friends is because they are scared of embarassment or being treated as an outcast. They feel they don't have the best approach to share their story while preserving their dignity, embarassment. We need them to feel they have a home. Annonymity is a priviledge that can be preserved through cryptographic solutions.

A platform that shares our vision. We are a mental health group where you get to share your stories about mental health, please join us because this will be useful to other people as well.

1. Share your story
1. We don't suggest you share medication data on here
1. We want stories social stories and this externally contributing to your mental health
1. Each mental health challenge is different from anxiety, stress and etc.
1. Ask yourself, do you want to share your story with others?

> **Note**: We care about your decision to share your stories. You might be unconfortable, and it is okay to submit annonymous stories. We provide the option to share your story to a group where you can share that with other members.
