**What we want to build**

> We want to find out if students can share their stories. We found out that sometimes individuals won't report to their families, friends etc. because they are scared of embarassment or being treated as an outcast. Some students best approach is to share their story while preserving their dignity, and from embarassment. We want to build around privacy preserving alternatives to their this need.
