## Approach

**Common myths: Specifically Nigeria**

1. They believe anything mental health means you are mad
1. For anyone to listen to your mental health concerns, you have to go to 1 on 1 therapy, which is not necessarily addressing most of the students concerns
1. A lower percentage of students actually need the 1 to 1 therapy

**Common Solutions**

1. If someone is stressed, they might not be yelling at you rather tend to need a break to cool off
1. Need for a communty support group
1. People come together to share experiences, have more people talking
1. Giving people their voice, people to be seen for who they are and not what others say about them
1. With a voice, you can amply your fears so they can continue working on it
1. Not everyone wants to go outside, sometimes someone just needs to sleep in because of being overwhelmed

**What we want to build**

> We want to find out if you would be okay sharing your story here. We found out that sometimes the reason that individuals don't share what they are going through with their families, friends is because they are scared of embarassment or being treated as an outcast. They feel they don't have the best approach to share their story while preserving their dignity, embarassment. We need them to feel they have a home. Annonymity is a priviledge that can be preserved through cryptographic solutions.

A platform that shares our vision. We are a mental health group where you get to share your stories about mental health, please join us because this will be useful to other people as well.

1. Share your story
1. We don't suggest you share medication data on here
1. We want stories social stories and this externally contributing to your mental health
1. Each mental health challenge is different from anxiety, stress and etc.
1. Ask yourself, do you want to share your story with others?

> **Note**: We care about your decision to share your stories. You might be unconfortable, and it is okay to submit annonymous stories. We provide the option to share your story to a group where you can share that with other members.
